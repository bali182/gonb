## thanks to

- All the devs maintaining the open source projects this one was built upon.
- Special thanks to @Danielku15 for open sourcing, maintaining, and providing quick and very appreciated help for [alphaTab](https://github.com/CoderLine/alphaTab), without which this project could not render and play tabs/scores, therfore would be completely pointless.
