This is a small UI project, that suggests walking basslines for your own chord progressions. You can check it out on the URL above.

There is **NO** registration / data collection of any type, and **NO** cookies of any type. The only semi-persistent storage this project uses is your browsers `localStorage` for storing your chord progressions (data lives on your own computer, no third party has access to it).

## build

- `git clone https://github.com/bali182/stick.git`
- `npm ci`
- happy coding :)

## thanks to

- All the devs maintaining the open source projects this one was built upon.
- Special thanks to @Danielku15 for open sourcing, maintaining, and providing quick and very appreciated help for [alphaTab](https://github.com/CoderLine/alphaTab), without which this project could not render and play tabs/scores, therfore would be completely pointless.
