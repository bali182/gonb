Practice or learn reading sheet music from random, but reasonably pleasant sounding melodies.

## How does this work?

- You configure what exactly you want to practice. This includes:
  - The **clef**
  - The **key signature**
  - The **time signature**
  - The exact **notes** you want to practice
  - The exact note (and rest) **durations** you want to practice
  - and more in **"Settings"**
- The app in turn generates
  - A random chord progression
  - A random melody on top, that fits your configuration
  - Any time you want a new one, hit **"Generate new"**

## Privacy

- There is **NO registration**, **NO cookies**, and **NO ads**.
- Once you load the page, it runs on **YOUR computer**
- And saves your configuration in **YOUR `localStorage`** (which only **YOU** have access to).
- This project is (and any possible future version always will be) **free**, and **open source**.

## Build

- `git clone https://github.com/bali182/sheet.git`
- `npm ci`
- happy coding :)
